This file documents the differences in the way I compile on my Macbook compared to Linux:

First, the command I use on Linux is:

g++ -Wall -ansi -pedantic main.cpp -o main -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system && ./main

And it works because paths are standard.
But on MacOS I have my libraries installed via homebrew and they are located at:

/opt/homebrew/include

Therefore this command turned out to be correct for compiling programs using SFML on Mac.

g++ -Wall -ansi -pedantic main.cpp -o main -I/opt/homebrew/include -L/opt/homebrew/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system && ./main
