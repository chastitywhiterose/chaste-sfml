Based on my understanding of reading about SFML, each version requires a specific C++ compiler version to be compatible. Since I am using GCC, I downloaded these specific files.

correct
https://github.com/brechtsanders/winlibs_mingw/releases/download/13.1.0-16.0.5-11.0.0-msvcrt-r5/winlibs-x86_64-posix-seh-gcc-13.1.0-mingw-w64msvcrt-11.0.0-r5.7z

A list of gcc versions can be found here:

The links to the compatible versions of SFML and GCC can be found on the download page:

After extracting and installing them into my preferred location, I have the following batch file which will compile and run an example program:

SET COMPILER_PATH=C:\SFML\mingw64\bin
SET SFML_PATH=C:\SFML\SFML-2.6.0
SET PATH=%COMPILER_PATH%;%SFML_PATH%\bin

g++ main.cpp -o main -I%SFML_PATH%\include -L%SFML_PATH%\lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system && main
